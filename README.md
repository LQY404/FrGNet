# FrGNet

This is the source code hub of our work "FrGNet: A fourier-guided weakly-supervised framework for nuclear instance segmentation".
In this framework, we construct a fourier guidance module to fuse the priori information into the training process of the model, which facilitates the model to capture the relevant features of the nuclear.

This work was completed in 2024.07.09, during working on Med+AI company, and we submit it to MedIA2024, on review.
