# FrGNet

This is the source code hub of our work "FrGNet: A fourier-guided weakly-supervised framework for nuclear instance segmentation".
In this framework, we construct a fourier guidance module to fuse the priori information into the training process of the model, which facilitates the model to capture the relevant features of the nuclea.
